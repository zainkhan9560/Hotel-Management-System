# 🏨 Hotel Management System (C++)

A console-based Hotel Management System developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in **C++**. This project simulates real-world hotel operations including room bookings, cancellations, admin controls, and customer request management.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Room Booking** — Users can check room availability and book rooms.
- ❌ **Cancellation** — Existing bookings can be cancelled with appropriate updates.
- 🔄 **Request Handling** — Customers can make special service requests (e.g., food, cleaning).
- 🏢 **Floor and Room Mapping** — Rooms are mapped across multiple floors for realistic navigation.
- 🔧 **Admin Panel** — Admin can manage room availability, view booking history, and handle customer data.
- ⏳ **Customer Queue System** — Bookings and requests are managed using queues for better flow control.
- ⚙️ **Priority-based Request Management** — Service requests are handled based on urgency/priority.

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Classes & Objects
- Inheritance & Polymorphism
- Encapsulation & Abstraction
- Data Structures: Queues, Arrays
- File Handling (optional, if used)
